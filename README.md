# Payment Verification

A free alternative to the bKash payment verification API developed in Java and Android.

### Overview

This app provides a free alternative to the bKash payment verification API. It efficiently verifies payments by reading and parsing bKash payment confirmation SMS messages on the user's phone. The app is designed to work seamlessly with Java code, ensuring prompt processing of payment information.

#### How It Works

1. **SMS Reading:** The app immediately reads bKash payment confirmation SMS messages as soon as they arrive on the user's phone.

2. **SMS Parsing:** The received SMS is parsed to extract key information, including the mobile number, arrival time, and Transaction ID.

3. **Server Communication:** The parsed information is promptly sent to the server for verification. If the internet connection is not already ON, the app activates it.

4. **Swift Verification:** With this streamlined process, payments can be verified within seconds.

### Technologies Used

- Java
- Android
- Javascript (for the development of the app's interface)
- HTML, CSS (for UI design)

# Vocabulary Preparation App
Feature-rich web application for processing vocabulary data. Developed in Java for Android, available on the Play Store. Paid app, no free version yet. Not much downloads. But all the downloads are paid users. I am afraid that I can't share the source code, because it's my business.

# Boolean expression comparetor
Takes two boolean expression of any number of variables. Compares those, and shows weather the expressions are same or not.
It's helpful when someone reduces a boolean expression and want to be sure that if the reduced form is correct or not. Using this application he can compare those expressions to verify. For example A+A!B+B!C+!AB!C is reduced to A+B!C . [Github repository Link](https://github.com/partho5/boolean-expression-comparetor)
