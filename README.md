## Let's talk about some projects

A web application that virtually merges multiple Gmail accounts into one, providing a seamless user experience. Utilizes Spring Boot, React.js, and PostgreSQL. Github repo link will be shared soon.

### Payment Verification
A free alternative to bKash payment verification API developed in Java and Android. [Github repository Link](https://github.com/partho5/payment-verification)

### Vocabulary Preparation App
Feature-rich web application for processing vocabulary data. Developed in Java for Android, available on the Play Store. Paid app, no free version yet. Not much downloads. But all the downloads are paid users. I am afraid that I can't share the source code, because it's my business.

### Convert any website into android app !
This is a very simple but useful & valuable project. Any website can be converted into an android app, just by changing a variable value, the url of desired website. [Github repository Link](https://github.com/partho5/convert-any-website-into-android-app)

### Boolean expression comparetor
Takes two boolean expression of any number of variables. Compares those, and shows weather the expressions are same or not.
It's helpful when someone reduces a boolean expression and want to be sure that if the reduced form is correct or not. Using this application he can compare those expressions to verify. For example A+A!B+B!C+!AB!C is reduced to A+B!C . [Github repository Link](https://github.com/partho5/boolean-expression-comparetor)

### Newspaper headlines crawler
Collects all the headlines from Daily Star, Jugantar, Ittefaq, Kaler Kantho - these newspapers. A HTML page is created as showing in the screenshot attached below. That page is just a list of headlines. So that user can skim through all the headlines and read only desired news. Reading this way s/he can read all important news of the day from 4 newspapers in significantly less amount of time. [Github repository Link](https://github.com/partho5/newspaper-headlines-crawler)
