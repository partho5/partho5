## Let's talk about some of my projects

# Google Drive Merge

A web application that virtually merges multiple Gmail accounts into one, providing a seamless user experience.

### Overview

If a user possesses 10 Gmail accounts, they have a total of 15 * 10 = 150 GB of free cloud storage. However, managing 10 different accounts can be overwhelming! This web application introduces a technique that virtually merges all accounts into one single account.

### Features

- **Account Merging:** Seamlessly merge multiple Gmail accounts into a single account.
  
### Usage

You can clone and deploy to your own server. Even it's possible to run it under localhost if you configure. Everything will work, but you can only access from your PC.

### Technologies Used

- Spring Boot
- React.js
- PostgreSQL
- Google API

Source code will be shared in github soon


# Payment Verification

A free alternative to the bKash payment verification API developed in Java and Android.

### Overview

This app provides a free alternative to the bKash payment verification API. It efficiently verifies payments by reading and parsing bKash payment confirmation SMS messages on the user's phone. The app is designed to work seamlessly with Java code, ensuring prompt processing of payment information.

#### How It Works

1. **SMS Reading:** The app immediately reads bKash payment confirmation SMS messages as soon as they arrive on the user's phone.

2. **SMS Parsing:** The received SMS is parsed to extract key information, including the mobile number, arrival time, and Transaction ID.

3. **Server Communication:** The parsed information is promptly sent to the server for verification. If the internet connection is not already ON, the app activates it.

### Technologies Used

- Java
- Javascript (for the development of the app's UI)
- HTML, CSS (for UI design)

# Vocabulary Preparation App
Feature-rich web application for processing vocabulary data. Developed in Java for Android, available on the Play Store. Paid app, no free version yet. Not much downloads. But all the downloads are paid users. I am afraid that I can't share the source code, because it's my business.

# Convert any website into android app !
This is a very simple but useful & valuable project. Any website can be converted into an android app, just by changing a variable value, the url of desired website. [Github repository link](https://github.com/partho5/convert-any-website-into-android-app)

# Boolean Expression Comparator

Takes two boolean expressions of any number of variables, compares them, and indicates whether the expressions are the same or not. This tool is useful when verifying the reduction of boolean expressions. Users can compare expressions to ensure the correctness of the reduced form.

### Overview

For example, if the original expression is A + A!B + B!C + !AB!C and it is reduced to A + B!C, the tool can be used to verify the reduction. If someone ends up with an incorrect solution like A + B!CA, the output will indicate the disparity.

Additionally, the tool generates a truth table for any number of variables.

### How It Works

1. **Expression Comparison:** Compares two boolean expressions to determine if they are the same or different.

2. **Verification Output:** Provides clear output indicating the result of the expression comparison, helping users identify errors in their reductions.

3. **Truth Table Generation:** Generates a truth table for any number of variables in the boolean expressions.

### Usage

1. Enter the two boolean expressions for comparison.

2. Click on the compare button to initiate the comparison process.

3. Review the output to verify the correctness of the reduction.

# IP Location

The simplest way to get a user's location using their IP address. This application takes an IP address as input and retrieves information such as country, city, region, ISP name (org), geolocation (latitude, longitude), postal code, timezone, response_time, etc. The project demonstrates how to achieve this using PHP, but you can implement it in any language using cURL.
